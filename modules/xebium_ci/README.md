Install everything you need to run a Xebium project on Jenkins.

You can connect to the X environment to see what is happening using a VNC viewer using the address of the system.

Currently, this module is *not stable* yet: it still configured Jenkins in an improper manner.

Don't forget to reboot the system when the installation had successfully finished.
