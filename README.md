[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) boxes are makefiles for virtual machines in [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/). They contain a small configuration, followed by a set of [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) or Chef scripts.

This repository will hold some boxes as an experiment to try to make development virtual machines easy to create.
